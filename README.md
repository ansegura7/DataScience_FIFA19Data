## Overview
Data Science Project to analyze and discover insights of the attributes of each player registered in the latest edition of FIFA 19 database.
Most of the project was done with Jupyter Notebook, so that the reader can see and understand the code implemented.

## Data
Detailed attributes for every player registered in the latest edition of FIFA 19 database:
- Original data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19" target="_blank" >Kaggle</a>
- Project data in <a href="https://github.com/ansegura7/DataScience_FIFA19Data/tree/master/data" target="_blank" >GitHub</a>

## Insights
- It is possible to perform a PCA of the skills of the players and maintain 80.5% of the variance of the data with only 2 components. Which allows us to plot the players on the plane and analyze which players resemble each other.
- The similarity between players is better identified with 2 components (2D plot and 80.5% variance explained) than with 3 components (3D plot and 84.8% variance explained).
- Using the Jambu Elbow technique, you can visually select a k = 4 (number of clusters between which the data will be grouped).
- Players can be grouped into 4 groups. These groups are highly related to the zones in which players play on the field (goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and strikers).
- The N players most similar to a specific player can be calculated, using the similarity functions.
- The matrix of correlation by individuals allows to see the correlation that exists between the players. It is the same item-item approach of the recommendation systems.
- Others:
    - The team with the most potential is FC Barcelona, whose players initially have an overall average of 78 but can reach 85.
    - The player with the most potential is MBappe from PSG, who can reach 95 of overall.
    - However, the player with the most improvement margen is Donnarumma of AC Milan, who initially has an overall of 82 but can reach 93 (+11).
